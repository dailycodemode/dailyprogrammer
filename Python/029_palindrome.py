#     return s == s[::-1]
#
# BREAKDOWN
# really good thing to remember here is that the '==' acts as a conditional statement so there
# was no need for me to add in the conditional because in a way all I'm doing is asking if True
# is equal to True
#
# SUMMARY
# the answer here is better as it is more concise. This was quite an easy question but what
# is really interesting is how short this was compared to the top Java answer which was 48 lines
# long. Which is entirely rediculous for such a short question. I thnik it is a good demonstration why
# python is a great language for these smaller problems. Java has its strengths too but you need to
# working on some much larger projects before Java would become my preferred language choice.

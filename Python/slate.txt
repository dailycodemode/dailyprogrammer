Jennie describes herself as a social drinker, the kind of person who spends two hours sipping a glass of wine. But when she took a job with an American embassy overseas, she learned quickly that it was easier to pretend to not drink at all than to partake in alcohol with her work colleagues.

“If I told gross old men, almost always married, that I didn’t drink, then they would leave me alone. It was like magic. No more after-work invites to the embassy bar, or up to their rooms for wine. No more come-ons or gross remarks, or at least way fewer. It was as if they realized that they had no chance with me unless I was somehow impaired. From then on, whenever I was at the embassy, I just acted like I didn’t drink for religious reasons. I think people thought I was Mormon.”

The downside was that she could never drink in front of her co-workers—even the glass of wine she’d sometimes wish she could have. But Jennie, who asked that I not use her last name for this piece so she can continue with this strategy, counsels other young women to consider adopting that same white lie, especially if they work in industries where drinking plays an outsize role.
